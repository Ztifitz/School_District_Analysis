# An in-depth look to the school district

## Objective

The goal of this analysis was to get an overview of the performance of the schools in a specific district. As time went on, news that a specific school had undergone some academic dishonesty motivated us to not take into account a specific class from Thomas High School. This new development caused slight changes in the analysis but after adapting to them, the results are as valid as our initial conclusions.

## Results
### How was the district summary affected?

This was our initial result:

This are the updated results:

While there are slight percentage changes, they are not significant. The reason that the change is so small is the big sample size from the number of students in the whole school district. Dropping 9th grade scores from one school (total of 461 students) was not impactful to the overall total of 30,000+ students. It is worth noting however, the deficiency in the % Passing Math column as a more aggressive effort should be made to guarantee the excelence in the student body of the schools.

### How was the school summary affected?

We will focus this section to the change in the Thomas High School statistics as we will touch on the better schools further ahead in our report.
This is the Thomas High School information before the update:

This is the Thomas High School Information after the update:

Since the percentage calculations were still being done with the student total a dcrease in percentage happened, so we had make an adjustment to the students that were being considered specifically for Thomas High School.

## How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

The effect was negative, as seen in he above tables but after dropping from the calculations the contaminated data, we get the following:

While the average math and reading scores staty relatively the same, the percentage change, due to the updated total now representing accurately the students being evaluated, goes up to its previous levels. This shows Thomas High School as one of the top rated schools in the district. Let us take a look at another chart that ranks the schools from top performers.

The original:

The update:

This is a sample size of the top 5 schools in the district and Thomas High School is still there.

## Math and reading scores by grade

On the left side we see the original analysis and on the right side the updated analysis. You can even notice that there is no calculation for the average math scores of 9th grade for Thomas High School. For completion, we add the average reading scores by grade as well:

## Scores by school spending

First, we show the original:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101848882/166184241-e737f2ca-bc21-4c04-8c9b-8b69d9cd6c37.png)

Now, the updated:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101848882/166184268-4eb0a8b9-4a3a-4cf6-932c-9be15faf972e.png)

In this metric there was no changes.

## Scores by school size

The original:

The update:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101848882/166184417-0fa621c8-aef1-446e-911e-3db83266a73e.png)

Again, no change, which means that school district seem to be equally attended.

## Scores by school type

The original:

The update:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101848882/166184524-3876ef01-a8d8-4742-82c5-53e4496bf78b.png)

Again, no changes, this makes us realize that probably one school inside may no t be that impactful to the dataset.

## Summary
The most significant change caused by a change in the analysis was in the percentage results of a specific school, in this cas Thomas High School. There sere small changes to the district summary table as it was a highly populated class. Anothte change was in that the school performance increased a small percentage but it remained in the second place district-wise, maybe if it coul be compared to other districts better conclusions could be obtained.The last thing that is note worthy is that the last charts did not change as, whether or not the students are being considered, the budget per student remanis the same, as well as the school population and the school type, so those metrics could not be affected by the changes made to the rest of the tables. Further analysis is encouraged to better our education system. Maybe goes further than just the district, although that goes in a State Department responsabilities.
